# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **`nutrition` command group** — View daily food logs, meal summaries, and nutrition settings by date (#36)
  - `gccli nutrition [date]` — View daily food log
  - `gccli nutrition meals [date]` — View meal summaries
  - `gccli nutrition settings [date]` — View nutrition settings

### Tests

- Added missing nutrition command test coverage: NoAccount, InvalidDate, and ServerError paths (#37)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Per-set duration and rest time** — exercise sets now support individual `:dSECS` and `:rSECS` suffixes for per-set duration and rest control (#34)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** removed global `--rest` flag from `activity exercise-sets set` — use per-set `:rSECS` suffix instead

### Docs

- Updated README, skill reference, and docs site with new exercise set format examples

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`activity exercise-sets set` command** — Log exercise sets (reps, weight, rest) for strength training activities (#32)
- **`exercises list` command** — Browse Garmin's exercise categories and exercises for strength training
- **`activity create --date` flag** — Set the activity start time when creating manual entries
- **`auth export` command** — Export credentials as a portable base64 string for transfer to another machine (#30)
- **`auth import` command** — Import credentials from another machine (accepts argument or stdin) (#30)

### Fixed

- **Auth rate limiting** — Login requests now automatically retry on HTTP 429 and 5xx responses with exponential backoff, fixing headless login failures on rate-limited environments (#30)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Restructured `skill/` into `skills/` directory with subdirectories (`skills/gccli/`, `skills/garmin-trainer/`)
- Added `garmin-trainer` skill for AI-assisted training plan generation

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **`events add` — Typed CLI flags replace JSON payload** (#27):
  - `--name`, `--date`, `--type` (required), plus `--race`, `--location`, `--distance` (e.g. `10km`, `26.2mi`), `--goal` (e.g. `50m`, `1h30m`), `--time`, `--timezone`, `--private`, `--note`, `--url`
  - `--primary` and `--training` flags are mutually exclusive for training priority
  - Distance strings (`10km`, `26.2mi`, `400m`) and goal durations (`50m`, `1h30m`, `2400s`) are parsed and validated at input time

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **`events add` command** — Create calendar events via raw JSON payload:
  - `gccli events add --params '{"eventName":"Race","date":"2026-09-27","eventType":"running"}'`
  - Supports all Garmin Connect event fields: time, location, distance, privacy, race flag, notes, URL
  - Set custom goals and training priority directly when creating: `eventCustomization` with `customGoal` (time-based) and `isPrimaryEvent`/`isTrainingEvent`
- **`events delete` command** — Delete a calendar event by ID with confirmation prompt (`-f` to skip)
- **Events API methods** — `AddEvent`, `DeleteEvent` in the API client
- **E2E test for events** — Full lifecycle test: create event with goal → list → delete → verify removed
- **MFA test coverage** — Tests for `ticketFromURL`, 429 rate limiting, ticket extraction from redirect URL, and signin params forwarding

### Fixed

- **Headless MFA login** — Forward signin query params to the MFA verification endpoint, matching garth behaviour. Without them Garmin SSO silently rejects the MFA submission. Also handle 429 rate limiting and extract tickets from redirect URLs. (Thanks to [@derbauer97](https://github.com/derbauer97) — #23)
- **Zsh completion** — Fix parse errors from empty case blocks and missing closing brace when sourced with `compinit`

### Docs

- Added Events section to website (feature card, command reference with goal/priority examples)
- Added events commands to skill reference (`skills/gccli/SKILL.md`)
- Added Buy Me a Coffee badge to README

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **`courses import` command** — Import GPX files as new courses on Garmin Connect:
  - `courses import route.gpx` — Import with default settings (cycling, private)
  - `--name "My Route"` — Override the course name
  - `--type hiking` — Set activity type (running, cycling, hiking, etc.)
  - `--privacy 1` — Set course privacy (1=public, 2=private, 4=group)
- **`courses delete` command** — Delete a course by ID with confirmation prompt (`-f` to skip)
- **Courses API methods** — `ImportCourseGPX`, `GetCourseElevation`, `SaveCourse`, `DeleteCourse` in the API client
- **E2E test for courses import+delete** — Full lifecycle test: import GPX → enrich elevation → save → verify → delete

### Fixed

- **Courses import save payload** — Filter import response to only API-accepted fields, set required defaults (`coursePrivacy`, `rulePK`, `coordinateSystem`, `sourceTypeId`, `startPoint`), and handle `latitude`/`longitude` field names correctly for elevation enrichment

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **`courses` command group** — New commands for managing Garmin Connect courses:
  - `courses list` — List all user courses with table/JSON/plain output
  - `courses favorites` — List favorite courses
  - `courses detail <id>` — View full course detail (JSON)
  - `courses send <course-id> <device-id>` — Send a course to a device via the device message API
- **Courses API methods** — `GetCourses`, `GetCourse`, `GetCourseFavorites`, `SendCourseToDevice` in the API client
- **E2E tests for courses** — End-to-end tests against the real Garmin Connect API

### Changed

- Updated Go module dependencies (`golang.org/x/net`)
- Updated CI dependencies (`actions/checkout` 4→6, `actions/setup-go` 5→6, `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` 6→7)

### Docs

- **Dependabot** — Automated dependency update checks via Dependabot configuration

### Fixed

### Docs

- Added community health files (contributing guide, code of conduct, etc.)
- Added architecture diagram to docs page

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`workouts schedule` subcommands** — Restructured `workouts schedule` from a single command into a command group with three subcommands:
  - `workouts schedule add <id> <date>` — Schedule a workout on a calendar date (replaces `workouts schedule <id> <date>`)
  - `workouts schedule list <date>` — List scheduled workouts for a date, with table/JSON/plain output
  - `workouts schedule remove <id> [-f]` — Remove a scheduled workout from the calendar with confirmation prompt
- **Calendar API** — New `GetCalendarWeek` API method to fetch calendar data from Garmin Connect
- **Unschedule API** — New `UnscheduleWorkout` API method to delete scheduled workouts

### Changed

- `workouts schedule` is now a command group instead of a leaf command; use `workouts schedule add` for the previous scheduling behavior
